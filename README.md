### The Hidden Costs of Traditional Security Practices

| High Costs              | Significant resources are needed for manual processes, driving up operational expenses.                                                               |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Manual Processes and Delays | Security reviews require significant effort, causing inefficiencies and lengthy review cycles that delay delivery timelines.                       |
| Drift and Misalignment     | Changes in design, code, and cloud infrastructure lead to misalignment with the organization's security policies.                                    |
| Lack of Visibility         | Security teams struggle to identify new initiatives that require security reviews, often resulting in overlooked risks.                              |
| Fragmented Tools         | Disjointed tools and processes-spanning platforms like Google Docs, PDFs, and Jira-make it challenging to maintain a centralized system for tracking security-related activities. |
